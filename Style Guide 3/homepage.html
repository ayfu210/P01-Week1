      <p>Our pet treats are all natural dog biscuits which are made in a variety of sizes and flavours to please all breeds of dogs. Only the finest, all natural, ingredients are used in our treats for our four-legged friends. Our dogs are part of our families – why shouldn’t they get the same quality food as our human family? We believe they deserve it! We use a mixture of veggies, flours and quality meats to pack a lot of flavour into a small bite. Baked and sourced with love in Vancouver from one group of dog lovers to another. Check out our treat shop to see what we’ve been cooking up!</p>
